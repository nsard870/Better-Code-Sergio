🐍 My Python Playground
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where Python scripts roam free, make friends, and sometimes crash spectacularly.

This repository is basically my Python learning diary — except instead of “Dear diary” it’s “Dear print() statement… why won’t you work?”.

Here you’ll find:

🧪 Experiments – me trying new Python features, libraries, and random ideas.

🛠 Mini-projects – small but mighty scripts that solve problems (or create new ones).

😂 Happy accidents – because every good learning journey needs a few bugs to keep things interesting.

⚠️ Warning:
Code quality may vary between “Wow, that’s clean” and “Did a caffeinated squirrel write this?”.
But hey, that’s what learning is all about!

Feel free to:

📚 Learn from my code

💡 Suggest improvements

🤝 Fork and have fun with it

Why is this public?
Because sharing is caring… and also because future me will thank present me for putting it somewhere safe.

P.S. If you see a script named something like test_OMG.py… don’t ask.
